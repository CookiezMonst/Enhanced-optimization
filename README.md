# Enhanced-optimization
A list of performance-enhancing mods (Fabric 1.19.3)
---
 - Some mods need customization to work best, or you can use my [config](https://github.com/CookiezMonst/Enhanced-optimization/releases/tag/First-release) as the default
- Contain mod in Alpha and Beta version. If you caught some trouble, feel free to give the issues, but for the best, I recommend checking or reporting it to the mod provider
- This is just a modpack to gain more FPS only, you can use other mods for sure BUT BE CAREFUL
- Recommend using [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/vi/corretto/) to replace OpenJDK to improve performance

 - Tips: 
      + Use "o" (The default keybind) to set the render scale of the game
